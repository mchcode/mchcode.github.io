    <p style="font-size:26px">Hello, Class. I am a locomotive engineer in North Platte, Nebraska. I am married and have
        two daughters. My daughters recently graduated from college. My wife and daughters have college degrees, and
        Pathway has allowed me to work towards my own degree.</p>
    <p style="font-size:26px">I am working on an Associate Degree in Applied Technology. I have not decided on a third
        certificate, yet. I feel blessed that I can receive a Church education online.</p>
    <p style="font-size:26px">For fun, I enjoy skateboarding and paleontology.</p>
